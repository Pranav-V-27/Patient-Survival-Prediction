# Patient Survival Prediction during COVID-19

During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers worldwide are facing challenges with overloaded hospitals, especially in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). One significant challenge is the lack of verified medical histories for incoming patients in critical condition. Patients may not be able to provide information about chronic conditions due to distress or confusion, and medical records may take days to transfer.

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of hospital death (binary variable) based on 84 other features. This predictive model can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about patient care, potentially improving patient survival outcomes.

## Problem Statement

The primary target feature is `hospital_death`, a binary variable indicating whether a patient survives or not.

## Tasks

The project will progress through a step-by-step classification process of the target variable based on the other 84 features. The aim is to build a robust model that accurately predicts hospital death.

## Evaluation Metric

The scoring metric for the model's performance is a combination of Accuracy and Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. This metric provides a comprehensive evaluation of the model's classification performance.
